  "briefing": "An experimental Typhoon class submarine, the Red October, has gone rogue and threatens to launch a nuclear attack on the United States. You must stop it at all costs.\n\nWe have been provided the sonar signature for the rogue submarine, but be aware that it is using a new silent drive technology and will be very difficult to detect. It has been reported that its sonar signature can be easily mistaken for a biologic. Use discretion and avoid firing on ocean life.\n\n<b>Primary Objectives:</b>\n- Sink the Red October\n"
