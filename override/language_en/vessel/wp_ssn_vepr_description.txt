[Unit Reference]
ShipClass=Vepr
Description=Vepr Class SSN
History=Self Noise Rating: 101 dB\nEscape Depth: 800 ft\n\nConsidered by Western observers to be a response to USS Triton, Project 741N and the other Vepr-class submarines demand respect from any opponent. Apparently a development of the Akula, the "Boar" features the Yasen's fire control improvements and the ability to launch the improved Ev. III UGST.\n\nUnlike the Yasen, the Vepr is a pure hunter/killer. Approach with caution.
