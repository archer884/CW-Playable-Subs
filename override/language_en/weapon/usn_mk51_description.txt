[Weapon Reference]
WeaponName=MK 51
WeaponDescriptiveName=Mark 51 H/K Torpedo
WeaponDescription=The Mark 51 Hunter/Killer torpedo is an all new, super heavyweight torpedo. Larger and heavier than the MK 48, the MK 51 boasts improved range, speed, and maneuverability over the MK 48 thanks to its greater fuel load and a powerful, vectoring duct.\n\nSheer size is the MK 51's main drawback, with the torpedo having been expressly designed to swim free from Triton's cavernous 710mm tubes.
